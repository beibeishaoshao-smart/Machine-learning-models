Feeder clubs are football clubs that primarily focus on identifying, developing, and nurturing young talent with the goal of selling these players to larger, wealthier clubs.
This project aims to use supervised machine learning to help feeder clubs predict two critical elements:
1. Which player attributes have the greatest impact on market value and can be trained
2. By extension, based on player metrics , whether certain players are overvalued or undervalued.
